We took part in the famous [HackYeah](https://hackyeah.pl/) at the end of 2019.

In 36 hours we came up with an app that is viable to assist you in studying. It's purpose is to help to learn a new thing or to consolidate existing knowlegde. It is based on scientific proven, spaced repetition technique.

Depending on your choises the app creates fitted learning blocks and then directly writes them down to your Google Calendar. The reminders about incoming session if you need them are up to you. 

The project was developed in pair programming.
